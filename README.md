# Advanced Machine Learning (GR5242) - Fall 2019

This repository contains useful files for the advanced machine learning course. It will be updated as the course progresses to include tutorials (python and tensorflow), code samples from lecture, homework assignments, and term-project information.

## Syllabus

Can be found [here](https://github.com/ElliottGordon/AdvML-Fall-19/blob/master/STAT_GR5242_syllabus.pdf).

## Colaboratory

In order to ensure that all students are working in a uniform environment, students will be expected to use [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to follow along with in-class coding examples and solve homework assignments. We will also provide some term-project ideas of an appropriate computational such that the resources provided by [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) will be adequate. An introduction to [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)  will be provided with the in-class [python_tutorial](https://github.com/ElliottGordon/AdvML-Fall-19/tree/master/python_tutorial).

## Python tutorial

Throughout the course, students will be expected to solve problems and create projects using the Python programming language. Prior knowledge or experience with the language is not assumed and a tutorial covering basic syntax, data structures, and libraries will be provided. Material pertaining to the the tutorial may be found in the [python_tutorial](https://github.com/ElliottGordon/AdvML-Fall-19/tree/master/python_tutorial) folder.

## Tensorflow tutorial

For the second half of the semester, students will be expected to use Tensorflow's Python API in order to construct and train deep neural networks. Once again, prior knowledge or experience using Tensorflow (through the Python or any other API) is not assumed and a tutorial will be provided in lecture. Material pertaining to the the tutorial may be found in the [tensorflow_tutorial](https://github.com/ElliottGordon/AdvML-Fall-19/tree/master/tensorflow_tutorial) folder.

## Homework Assignments

PDFs containing the homework assignments may be found in the [homeworks](https://github.com/ElliottGordon/AdvML-Fall-19/tree/master/homeworks) folder. Released solutions can be found on courseworks.
